Zembo: Scaling E-Mobility in Uganda

**Zembo** is a Ugandan e-mobility company focused on retrofitting traditional gas-powered boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) into electric bikes. As boda-bodas form the backbone of Uganda’s transportation system, Zembo sells its electric bikes directly to consumers and through a lease-to-own model. However, the company faces significant competition, high electricity costs, and grid reliability challenges. Despite this, Uganda generates the majority of its energy from sustainable sources, with 82% from hydro power.

This document outlines a 5-year strategy and financial model aimed at establishing Zembo as an energy company, boosting profitability, promoting local economic development, enabling social empowerment, and ensuring sustainability while capturing a larger market share to become a leader in Uganda’s e-mobility sector.

## Addressing Uganda's Energy Challenges

Uganda’s energy landscape presents both opportunities and challenges for e-mobility businesses:

- **Grid Unreliability**: Frequent power outages and limited rural infrastructure hinder the consistent operation of charging and swapping stations.
- **High Electricity Costs**: Despite abundant hydro resources, energy prices remain volatile, impacting operational expenses.

Leveraging Uganda’s solar potential will be key for Zembo to mitigate these challenges and ensure sustainable, cost-effective energy solutions for its fleet.

## Strategic 5-Year Expansion Plan

Zembo’s 5-year expansion strategy is based on three pillars designed to establish the company as a market leader:

1. **Geographic Expansion Across Uganda**: Expanding beyond Kampala to tap into underserved regions.
2. **Swap Station Network Expansion**: Deploying a hybrid model of internal growth (solar and grid-powered stations) and franchise-based swap cabinets to scale rapidly.
3. **B2B Partnerships for Bike Sales**: Collaborating with medical delivery services and last-mile logistics companies to drive demand for electric bikes.

This strategy aims to boost profitability, foster local economic development, and ensure long-term business sustainability.

## Data-Driven Decision-Making with Gurobi Optimization

To optimize Zembo’s geographic expansion, we used **Gurobi Optimization** alongside **ArcGIS** to determine the most efficient cities for expansion. The model maximized population coverage while minimizing the number of required stations, adhering to the following constraints:

- A maximum of 30 internal hybrid stations, 20 grid stations, and 20 franchise cabinets.
- Placement of at least one franchise cabinet in each high-population city.
- Ensuring one station every 30 kilometers.

### Results:

- **401 km of new routes**
- **877,343 additional people reached**
- **57 new swap stations** across eight new cities
- **Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)** of 7,896 bikes

Further data refinement and real-time tracking will enhance the model’s accuracy, guiding Zembo’s future station placements and expansion.

## Franchise Model for Rapid Growth

Zembo’s hybrid swap station network combines internal stations with franchise swap cabinets, enabling faster growth with lower upfront capital investment:

- **Internal Expansion**: Opening 30 hybrid stations and 20 grid-powered stations.
- **Franchise Swap Cabinets**: Each cabinet requires a $6,000 investment, affordable for middle-class urban Ugandans with a 5-year payback plan. This model promotes local economic growth and ensures operational consistency through automated systems, which are monitored via continuous data transfer.

## B2B Partnerships: Expanding Market Reach

Collaborating with key players in the medical and logistics sectors will further drive demand:

- **Medical Deliveries**: Partnerships with **Medsap Africa**, **Eminent Pharmaceutical Distributors**, and **Project Last Mile** to facilitate efficient transport of medicines and personnel.
- **Express Deliveries**: Collaborations with **DHL**, **FedEx**, and **Skynet** to enhance last-mile delivery capabilities.

These partnerships are expected to generate **1,677 new bike sales** over the next five years, bolstering Zembo’s market presence.

## Empowering Communities through Social Impact Financing

Our **social impact financing** model enables local communities to own franchises, fostering economic development and accountability. This model is inspired by **Grameen Bank** and includes two types of community-owned swap stations:

1. **Community Purchase**: Groups of 25 individuals can invest, saving UGX 400,000 monthly to cover upfront costs and achieving positive cash flow by Year 2.
2. **Government Community Purchase**: Government purchases with community upkeep. Profits will be reinvested in local projects such as schools and healthcare facilities.

## Conclusion: A Sustainable Future for Zembo

Zembo’s hybrid expansion strategy, driven by data-powered decision-making and community empowerment, positions the company to overcome energy challenges and lead Uganda’s e-mobility market. By integrating sustainability, innovation, and local economic development, Zembo is not only scaling its business but also contributing to a greener, more resilient Uganda.
